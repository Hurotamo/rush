### Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Git signing is required. Branching rulesets have been applied to prevent unsigned commits. See [Git Signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) for more details.

If you can write a code then create a [`Pull Request`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to this repo and we will review your code.

Please submit your `Pull Request` to the ```main``` `nightly` branch. We will auto reject if you submit your `Pull Request` to the ```stable``` branch or any release candidate branch.

### Documentation

Currently, we have a public [Rush - Technical Specification](https://mirrorworldfun.notion.site/Rush-Technical-Specification-1232d67d7b5f80bdbb88e4aee3378856?pvs=4) document on Notion for contributors to get an overview of Rush documentation and reducing overhead of maintainbility in the Rush monorepo.

If your change requires a documentation change, kindly state clearly how you intend to change this technical specification document to accommodate your new change and provide relevant links.
